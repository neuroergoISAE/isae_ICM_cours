    "The purpose of this tutorial is to implement a reactive BCI using SSVEP on a dataset collected in our laboratory. You will use MNE to load and pre-process the data and Sklearn+MNE for the classification part. \n",

    "- In Section I, exploration data analysis, frequency analysis and epoching using MNE\n",
    "- In Section II, a first classifier is trained on SNR at stimulation frequencies\n",
    "- In Section III, another pipeline that uses Canonical Correlation Analysis with sinus templates to learn a spatial filter.\n",
    "- In Section IV, a more advance pipeline based on Task Related Correlation Analysis that add individual templates from calibration data and temporal filterbank to CCA pipeline.\n",
    "- The last section (V) explores more comfortable stimulation for SSVEP-based BCI (lower amplitude)\n",

    "The code must be completed after each **Question** to work, where \"HERE\" appears as a comment in the code. The parameters that do not change the course of the story are accompanied \"EDIT ME!\" as a comment: you can change them at the time or at the end of the section to see the changes involved."
